Introduction
============

TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which
introduces a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse
array data with support for fast updates. It offers numerous features,
including excellent compression, high IO performance on multiple data
persistence backends (e.g., HDFS and S3), and easy integration with
ecosystems used by todayâ€™s data scientists (e.g., Python NumPy).

History
-------

TileDB was originally created at the Intel Science and Technology Center for
Big Data, a collaboration between Intel Labs and MIT. The research project
was published in a
`VLDB 2016 paper <https://people.csail.mit.edu/stavrosp/papers/vldb2017/VLDB17_TileDB.pdf>`_.
`TileDB, Inc. <https://tiledb.io>`_ was founded in February 2017 to continue the
further development and maintenance of the TileDB software.
