TileDB Documentation
====================

TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which
introduces a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse
array data with support for fast updates. It offers numerous features,
including excellent compression, high IO performance on multiple data
persistence backends (e.g., HDFS and S3), and easy integration with
ecosystems used by todayâ€™s data scientists (e.g., Python NumPy).

TileDB is open-sourced under the permissive
`MIT License <https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.

Here you will find a comprehensive description of all the TileDB features,
installation guides, tutorials, and API references. Enjoy!
