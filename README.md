**Array data management made fast and easy.**

TileDB allows you to manage the massive dense and sparse multi-dimensional array data that frequently arise in many important scientific applications.

## What is TileDB?

TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which introduces a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse array data with support for fast updates and reads. It features excellent compression and an efficient parallel I/O system with high scalability.

TileDB is open-sourced under the permissive MIT License.

## Features

* **Novel Format**.
TileDB introduces a novel multi-dimensional array format that effectively handles both dense and sparse data with fast updates.
* **Parallelism**.
TileDB is process-/thread-safe and supports asynchronous I/O, making it easy to write efficient parallel computational engines on top.
* **Performance**.
TileDB is developed in C and C++ with low-level optimizations, targeting superb performance.
* **Integration**.
TileDB exposes a C API that makes it easy to integrate with higher-level languages.
* **Compression**.
TileDB offers a variety of compression mechanisms, such as Gzip, Bzip2, LZ4, ZStandard, Blosc, double-delta and run-length encoding.
